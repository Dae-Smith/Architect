If you have moved into a new home, it would be the best time to bring in a designer so that everything from color/paint selection to furniture can be appropriately selected to reflect the client. Also, we are trained in selecting items of appropriate size and scale for a space and how to minimize or maximize space or areas.

Architects are adept at structural problem-solving and creative design for both exterior and interior building design. Interior architecture focuses on the functionality of a space. This form of architecture is often confused with interior design, which focuses more on aesthetics.
